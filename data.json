This should include nursing staff on wards, as well as clinical staff.

Breach should result in regulatory consequences attributable to an organisation in the case of a system failure and to individual accountability where individual professionals are responsible. Where serious harm or death has resulted to a patient as a result of a breach of the fundamental standards, criminal liability should follow and failure to disclose breaches of these standards to the affected patient (or concerned relative) and a regulator should also attract regulatory consequences. Breaches not resulting in actual harm but which have exposed patients to a continuing risk of harm to which they would not otherwise have been exposed should also be regarded as unacceptable."

It should be a defence for the provider to prove that all reasonably practicable steps have been taken to prevent a breach, including having in place a prescribed system to prevent such a breach."

            "Recommendation": "Sharing of intelligence between regulators needs to go further than sharing of existing concerns identified as risks. It should extend to all intelligence which when pieced together with that possessed by partner organisations may raise the level of concern. Work should be done on a template of the sort of information each organisation would find helpful."

To the extent that it is not practical in a written report to set out detail, this should be made available via each trust’s website. Reports should no longer be confined to reports on achievements as opposed to a fair representation of areas where compliance has not been achieved. A full account should be given as to the methods used to produce the information.\nTo make or be party to a wilfully or recklessly false statement as to compliance with safety or essential standards in the required quality account should be made a criminal offence."

Inspections of NHS hospital care providers should be led by such inspectors who should have the support of a team, including service user representatives, clinicians and any other specialism necessary because of particular concerns. Consideration should be given to applying the same principle to the independent sector, as well as to the NHS."

            "Recommendation": "A merger of system regulatory functions between Monitor and the Care Quality Commission should be undertaken incrementally and after thorough planning.

It would be vital to retain the corporate memory of both organisations."

            "Recommendation": "A duty of utmost good faith should be imposed on applicants for foundation trust status to disclose to the regulator any significant information material to the application and to ensure that any information is complete and accurate. This duty should continue throughout the application process, and thereafter in relation to the monitoring of compliance."

They should be an independent, professionally qualified check on the quality of service, in particular in relation to an assessment of outcomes. They need to have internal systems enabling them to be aware of patterns of concern, so that they do not merely treat each case on its individual merits. They have a responsibility to all their patients to keep themselves informed of the standard of service available at various providers in order to make patients’ choice reality. A GP’s duty to a patient does not end on referral to hospital, but is a continuing relationship.

In relation to each such standard, it should agree a method of measuring compliance and redress for non-compliance.

Commissioners must also have the capacity to undertake their own (or independent) audits, inspections, and investigations. These should, where appropriate, include investigation of individual cases and reviews of groups of cases.   The possession of accurate, relevant, and useable information from which the safety and quality of a service can be ascertained is the vital key to effective commissioning, as it is to effective regulation.

There should be lay members of the commissioner’s board.   Commissioners should create and consult with patient forums and local representative groups. Individual members of the public (whether or not members) must have access to a consultative process so their views can be taken into account.   There should be regular surveys of patients and the public more generally.

The system should apply to healthcare support workers, whether they are working for the NHS or independent healthcare providers, in the community, for agencies or as independent agents.

            "Recommendation": "An alternative option to enforcing compliance with a management code of conduct, with the risk of disqualification, would be to set up an independent professional regulator. The need for this would be greater if it were thought appropriate to extend a regulatory requirement to a wider range of managers and leaders. The proportionality of such a step could be better assessed after reviewing the experience of a licensing provision for directors."

            "Recommendation": "A training facility could provide the route through which an accreditation scheme could be organised. Although this might be a voluntary scheme, at least initally, the objective should be to require all leadership posts to be filled by persons who experience some shared training and obtain the relevant accreditation, enhancing the spread of the common culture and providing the basis for a regulatory regime."

            "Recommendation": "The General Medical Council should have regard to the possibility of commissioning peer reviews pursuant to section 35 of the Medical Act 1983 where concerns are raised in a generic way, in order to be advised whether there are individual concerns. Such reviews could be jointly commissioned with the Care Quality Commission in appropriate cases."

            "Recommendation": "To act as an effective regulator of nurse managers and leaders, as well as more front-line nurses, the Nursing and Midwifery Council needs to be equipped to look at systemic concerns as well as individual ones. It must be enabled to work closely with the systems regulators and to share their information and analyses on the working of systems in organisations in which nurses are active. It should not have to wait until a disaster has occurred to intervene with its fitness to practise procedures. Full access to the Care Quality Commission information in particular is vital."
          },
          {
            "Recommendation": "The Nursing and Midwifery Council needs to have its own internal capacity to assess systems and launch its own proactive investigations where it becomes aware of concerns which may give rise to nursing fitness to practise issues. It may decide to seek the cooperation of the Care Quality Commission, but as an independent regulator it must be empowered to act on its own if it considers it necessary in the public interest. This will require resources in terms of appropriately expert staff, data systems and finance. Given the power of the registrar to refer cases without a formal third party complaint, it would not appear that a change of regulation is necessary, but this should be reviewed."

          {
            "Recommendation": "It is of concern that the administration of the Nursing and Midwifery Council, which has not been examined by  this Inquiry, is still found by other reviews to be wanting. It is imperative in the public interest that this is remedied urgently. Without doing so, there is a danger that the regulatory gap between the Nursing and Midwifery Council and the Care Quality Commission will widen rather than narrow."

            "Recommendation": "It is highly desirable that the Nursing and Midwifery Council introduces a system of revalidation similar to that of the General Medical Council, as a means of reinforcing the status and competence of registered nurses, as well as providing additional protection to the public. It is essential that the Nursing and Midwifery Council has the resources and the administrative and leadership skills to ensure that this does not detract from its existing core function of regulating fitness to practise of registered nurses."

            "Recommendation": "The profile of the Nursing and Midwifery Council needs to be raised with the public, who are the prime and most valuable source of information about the conduct of nurses. All patients should be informed, by those providing treatment or care, of the existence and role of the Nursing and Midwifery Council, together with contact details. The Nursing and Midwifery Council itself needs to undertake more by way of public promotion of its functions."

          {
            "Recommendation": "It is essential that, so far as practicable, Nursing and Midwifery Council procedures do not obstruct the progress of internal disciplinary action in providers. In most cases it should be possible, through cooperation, to allow both to proceed in parallel. This may require a review of employment disciplinary procedures, to make it clear that the employer is entitled to proceed even if there are pending Nursing and Midwifery Council proceedings."
          },
          {
            "Recommendation": "The Nursing and Midwifery Council could consider a concept of employment liaison officers, similar to that of the General Medical Council, to provide support to directors of nursing. If this is impractical, a support network of senior nurse leaders will have to be engaged in filling this gap."
          },

            "Recommendation": "While both the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council have highly informative internet sites, both need to ensure that patients and other service users are made aware at the point of service provision of their existence, their role and their contact details."
          },

          {
            "Recommendation": "The Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA) (formerly the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence), together with the regulators under its supervision, should seek to devise procedures for dealing consistently and in the public interest with cases arising out of the same event or series of events but involving professionals regulated by more than one body. While it would require new regulations, consideration should be given to the possibility of moving towards a common independent tribunal to determine fitness to practise issues and sanctions across the healthcare professional field."

            "Recommendation": "There needs to be effective teamwork between all the different disciplines and services that together provide the collective care often required by an elderly patient; the contribution of cleaners, maintenance staff, and catering staff also needs to be recognised and valued."
          },
          {
            "Recommendation": "Regular interaction and engagement between nurses and patients and those close to them should be systematised through regular ward rounds:   All staff need to be enabled to interact constructively, in a helpful and friendly fashion, with patients and visitors.   Where possible, wards should have areas where more mobile patients and their visitors can meet in relative privacy and comfort without disturbing other patients.   The NHS should develop a greater willingness to communicate by email with relatives.   The currently common practice of summary discharge letters followed up some time later with more substantive ones should be reconsidered.   Information about an older patient’s condition, progress and care and discharge plans should be available and shared with that patient and, where appropriate, those close to them, who must be included in the therapeutic partnership to which all patients are entitled."
          },
          {
            "Recommendation": "The care offered by a hospital should not end merely because the patient has surrendered a bed – it should never be acceptable for patients to be discharged in the middle of the night, still less so at any time without absolute assurance that a patient in need of care will receive it on arrival at the planned destination. Discharge areas in hospital need to be properly staffed and provide continued care to the patient."

            "Recommendation": "In the absence of automatic checking and prompting, the process of the administration of medication needs to be overseen by the nurse in charge of the ward, or his/her nominated delegate. A frequent check needs to be done to ensure that all patients have received what they have been prescribed and what they need. This is particularly the case when patients are moved from one ward to another, or they are returned to the ward after treatment."

If this cannot be done, there needs to be a system whereby ward leaders and named nurses are responsible for ensuring that the observations are carried out and recorded."
          },
          {
            "Recommendation": "There is a need for all to accept common information practices, and to feed performance information into shared databases for monitoring purposes. The following principles should be applied in considering the introduction of electronic patient information systems:   Patients need to be granted user friendly, real time and retrospective access to read their records, and a facility to enter comments. They should be enabled to have a copy of records in a form useable by them, if they wish to have one. If possible, the summary care record should be made accessible in this way.   Systems should be designed to include prompts and defaults where these will contribute to safe and effective care, and to accurate recording of information on first entry.   Systems should include a facility to alert supervisors where actions which might be expected have not occurred, or where likely inaccuracies have been entered.   Systems should, where practicable and proportionate, be capable of collecting performance management and audit information automatically, appropriately anonymised direct from entries, to avoid unnecessary duplication of input.   Systems must be designed by healthcare professionals in partnership with patient groups to secure maximum professional and patient engagement in ensuring accuracy, utility and relevance, both to the needs of the individual patients and collective professional, managerial and regulatory requirements.\nSystems must be capable of reflecting changing needs and local requirements over and above nationally required minimum standards."

          },
          {
            "Recommendation": "The Care Quality Commission and/or Monitor should keep the accuracy, fairness and balance of quality accounts under review and should be enabled to require corrections to be issued where appropriate.

The threat level was severe. That meant that a terrorist attack was highly likely.", "changeType": ""},

          {"Recommendation": " If Mohammed Agha and Kyle Lawler had considered the concerns expressed to them about SA in light of the threat level, they would have made greater efforts to ensure those concerns were reported to their supervisors.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " If BTP officers had that level of risk in their minds when they carried out their duties that night, they would not have been absent for such a long period from the public areas of the Victoria Exchange Complex. In particular, one of them would have been in the City Room in the half hour period before egress and therefore during part of the period that SA waited there before detonating his bomb.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " One of the reasons why inadequate attention was paid to the threat level was that it had been in place for some years. I make no criticism in respect of the length of the period during which a severe risk was identified. As long as the threat level is severe, the appropriate level of vigilance must be maintained. The problem is that it becomes more and more difficult to ensure that people maintain the high level of alertness required in relation to potential dangers. A high level of alertness needs to be maintained when the threat level is severe. It is necessary to continuously remind those whose job includes being alert to the terrorist threat of the level of it and what that level means in relation to the possibility of an attack.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " There ought to be a risk assessment for every venue. A specific risk assessment for each event which involves the attendance of a substantial number of people. All risk assessments for large concert venues should include consideration of the risk of a terrorist attack. Inadequate consideration of that risk may result in incorrectly identifying a low risk. This in turn may cause those responsible for security to be insufficiently alert. That is what occurred here.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " It was suggested during the evidence that this was unnecessary, as everyone knew the threat level of a terrorist attack and would have regard to it in the way they behaved. I do not agree. While in theory that may be true, the discipline of undertaking a risk assessment will assist in keeping the threat of terrorism at the forefront of the minds of those who prepare for the event. Robust procedures are necessary to counter the threat of a terrorist attack. The purposes of those procedures and the necessity of following them must be understood by those carrying them out.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " The following are three examples of procedures which should have been more robust.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " It needed to be made absolutely clear and to be understood by the BTP officers that patrolling the areas of egress in the half hour before the end of the concert was not optional, it was mandatory because of the security risk. There needed to be at least one experienced police officer on duty at the Victoria Exchange Complex on the occasions of concerts, preferably a sergeant, in addition to inexperienced officers, to ensure that nobody forgot the threat level and carried out their instructions with it in mind.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " The pre‑egress checks carried out by Showsec ignored almost entirely the terrorist threat. Those checks concentrated instead on making sure that the exit routes for the crowd were clear. That was important but it was also important that there should have been a counter‑terrorism aspect to the checks. Anyone who had the threat level at the forefront of their mind would have realised that.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " Showsec should have understood that its staff had a responsibility to check the mezzanine as part of a security patrol. SMG should have had a system in place to make sure that security patrols were taking place and being carried out properly.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " In order for necessary security procedures to be maintained, each person needs to be reminded of the counter‑terrorism aspect of their activities. The message that counter‑terrorism measures are vital needs to be constantly reinforced. Those responsible for security should be briefed at every event about the current threat level and risk of terrorist attack.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " I accept that repeating the same warning about terrorism as part of each briefing creates a risk of it being ignored and those who have heard it before may listen less than attentively.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " The evidence I heard from Showsec is a good illustration of this issue. The Showsec supervisors’ and stewards’ briefings on 22nd May 2017 both include the importance of being vigilant for suspicious behaviour. As the events which followed demonstrate, that was insufficient to keep people safe. However, the fact that this measure was not effective on this occasion is not a reason to abandon it. Rather, it is a reason to do it better.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " Those receiving the warning about the risk of attack have to be aware of the potential that they will become desensitised to the message. Those giving the warning need to be aware of this and must try to refresh the message so that it is sufficiently updated and relevant to attract the attention of the listener.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " Showsec operated a system of having a period within the supervisors’ briefing for a particular topic which was selected from a number of possible options, one of which was counter‑terrorism. This was, in my view, a good way to ensure that additional detail was provided without the subject matter becoming stale. Any and all suspicious behaviour by event‑goers or members of the public close to a venue must be noted. It must be reported promptly so that investigations can be made and action taken, if appropriate.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " When this recommendation is followed there will be false alarms. While this may be frustrating, it is important that the way false alarms are dealt with does not discourage the reporting of suspicious behaviour. If unnecessary reports are made, the remedy should be to train staff better to recognise suspicious behaviour, rather than criticise them for making the report. It is not easy for staff, particularly junior ones, to make reports that they know may result in disruption to an event or inconvenience a large number of people. They need to be given the confidence to do so.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " Bomb hoaxes can cause great inconvenience, but no‑one can safely ignore bomb warnings. So it is with suspicious behaviour. It should only be ignored when an innocent explanation has been verified. There was evidence of a number of such false alarms during the Inquiry, but staff should be congratulated and not criticised either expressly or implicitly for raising the alarm. Showsec and SMG were clear that they did their best to get this message across but, on the evidence, it did not seem to have got through to all of their staff. In particular, the system for capturing reports and ensuring their proper investigation was not sufficiently robust.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " Where hostile reconnaissance is suspected it needs to be properly recorded and reported to the police. The police should investigate it and report back. Briefings to security staff need to include details of the suspected hostile reconnaissance. This is so that staff know what has happened and know what to look out for.", "changeType": ""},

These Protect Duty‑holders should be able to take the necessary steps by accessing publicly available information as to how they should approach their tasks.

The higher‑level training provided by the SIA for employees occupying certain positions should be retained but it is important that managers and all employees have some training. ACT which is a training scheme set up by NaCTSO is suitable for people working in the industry at all levels. All people working in venues such as the Arena should be trained in the basics of counter‑terrorism. The nature of the threat changes so it is important that there is regular refresher training."

              "Recommendation": "It was a common feature of the regulatory schemes that I have heard about during the Inquiry that there were insufficient resources to carry out proper enforcement. The consequence of that is that there have been a number of breaches of regulations which might have been avoided with more active enforcement."

            {
              "Recommendation": "It is important that there is proper enforcement of the Protect Duty, the possible consequences of breaches are so serious that proper steps need to be taken to avoid them happening. It is possible that CTSAs, licensing officers, police licensing enforcement officers and the SIA could all combine to provide enforcement. Even if that happens, it is likely that more people will be required to carry out the work. When cutbacks occur, enforcement can be one of the first areas to lose staff. It would be a false economy in relation to enforcement of the Protect Duty. I recommend that an adequate and effective enforcement process is established in relation to the Protect Duty."

              "Recommendation": "The proposal is that there should be a system of enforcement to ensure that the terms of the Protect Plan which has been determined are complied with. I am satisfied on the evidence that I have heard that there needs to be an enforcement mechanism and the ability to impose a penalty if there is a breach. Part of the reason for the failure of other schemes has been that they have been voluntary. The Consultation suggests that the penalty should be restricted to a civil penalty which would be financial. In those circumstances there would be no conviction. While it is not unusual to have civil penalties for regulatory failures, provision is often made for criminal prosecutions and more severe penalties in more serious cases. I would recommend that the same should apply for breaches of the Protect Duty. It should be borne in mind that this is an area where the possibility of a severe sentence could have a deterrent effect."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "In my view, there is no good reason to put in place an enforcement regime that is any less rigorous or robust in terms of inspection, enforcement and penalty than that which exists in the parallel health and safety legislation. Given what is at stake, namely the lives of people going about their everyday business, there is every reason to make the Protect Duty equally rigorous and robust."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "Whatever the legislature decides about penalty for breach, inspection and enforcement is likely to be the main deterrent. A proper inspection regime needs to be in force so that serious security breaches are identified and promptly remedied. Even if enforcement is regarded as light touch it is important that there is proper inspection. An effective enforcement regime requires sufficient people to do it properly. All the evidence that I heard suggests that insufficient resources have been put into the present inspection regimes. A proper inspection policy should provide for unannounced inspections as well as planned ones. It may be that the roles of different inspectors can be combined so that for example inspectors looking to see that the Protect Duty was being complied with could also be checking in appropriate locations that licensing conditions are being observed."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I envisage that this may follow a similar approach to that used in relation to health and safety and food standards. By this I mean the existence of a mechanism for issuing a formal notice setting out the remedial steps which are required in relation to any identified deficiencies. For extreme situations, there must be provision for issuing a notice that prevents a venue from operating until remedial steps have been taken. The notice will provide a timescale for compliance. It will also be necessary to have an appeal process for the adjudication on the appropriateness of the terms of the notice, should there be a dispute. It should be a criminal offence to fail to comply with a valid notice without reasonable excuse."

              "Recommendation": "Operators, and people who work for them, are often under financial pressure to try and make savings as has been evident during this Inquiry. I understand that is the commercial reality, but it does mean that a proper inspection regime is needed to give some assurance that savings will not be made at the cost of safety. The security measures may be expensive. It must be more costly to an organisation and individuals to cut corners than to comply with the Protect Duty."

CTSAs, the SIA, the Licensing Authority, the Health and Safety Executive and the police all have responsibilities for public safety at premises of this kind. They need to understand what each of them is doing in relation to any particular premises so they do not duplicate but can provide complementary services. I will be reviewing the progress of this as part of my monitoring of the Protect Duty."

              "Recommendation": "The suggestion made by Showsec that NaCTSO should set up a centralised online library where it will be possible to access training material is a good one. This will help in particular smaller organisations who cannot afford to employ professional help to assist them with a Protect Duty. Thought will need to be given to how access might be gained to this to ensure that this information is not misused by those seeking to do harm."

              "Recommendation": "The approach taken by SMG in its written risk assessments involved a numerical assessment of the likelihood of a terrorist attack. This was then used as a multiplier against a severity score. I have considerable reservations about this approach being used in connection with the threat from terrorism. This concern arises from the potential that a strictly statistical approach may suppress any total score to the point where the risk of a terrorist attack is regarded as being sufficiently low as to be acceptable and no action is taken."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "There are at least three ways that this could be addressed. One option is to remove consideration of likelihood from the process altogether. This will result in a focus on what can be done without providing for an opportunity for the thought, ‘It will not happen to me’, entering the process. Another is to import it only in relation to drawing a distinction between different attack methodologies. Some spaces may be naturally highly protected from a particular form of attack. In those circumstances, having a mechanism to ensure focus is on the more likely methodologies may be advantageous. A third approach may be to ensure that the severity score range is sufficiently wide so that even when a low likelihood is applied, the total score still remains high enough to produce the necessary measures. A high severity score is clearly justified when considering the very high degree of harm a terrorist attack is capable of causing. I do not believe that a range of between 1 to 5, as was used by SMG, is sufficiently wide."

            {
              "Recommendation": "However, I have not heard sufficient evidence to express a concluded view  on the best way to complete such a risk assessment.

              "Recommendation": "As I have already set out, the SIA licences individuals working in the security industry to carry out certain activities. Amongst those activities is operating CCTV over a public space. At present, a licence is only required by those who monitor CCTV under a contract for services. In‑house CCTV operators do not need a licence. Although an attempt was made to justify the reasoning for this distinction by Tony Holyland, a senior employee at the SIA, I was unpersuaded. This distinction has been considered in the past, but no change has been made. In‑house operators carry out the same job as those who monitor CCTV under a contract for services. The Inquiry heard evidence that more than one SMG employee who carried out monitoring of CCTVs asked for training but were not given it. There seems to me to be no persuasive reason why a licence should not be mandatory for those operating in‑house as well as those working under a contract for services. I recommend that the distinction is abolished. All of those who monitor CCTV should be required to hold an SIA CCTV operator’s licence."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "In addition to licensing individuals, the SIA runs an Approved Contractor Scheme (ACS). This is a voluntary scheme and, while individuals who carry out security work may require a licence or licences depending on what functions they carry out, companies who provide security and supervise these activities do not. While the ACS provides assurance that the member is a fit and proper person, there is nothing to prevent someone who is not a member of the scheme setting up and running a company providing security services. The SIA promotes good practice through its ACS. But there is no compulsion on companies to become a member or carry out good practice. While checks are made on how a company conducts its business when it applies to join the scheme, self‑certification plays a considerable part in the process."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that consideration is given to amending the SIA legislation to require that companies which carry out security work which may include a counter‑terrorism element are required to be licensed. This will ensure that only fit and proper companies carry out this work. It will also ensure that they are aware of and guard against the risks of terrorist attacks at the events where they operate and carry out proper procedures, including training to mitigate those risks."

              "Recommendation": "Training for an SIA qualification is designed to be mainly classroom‑based. The SIA does not provide the training itself nor does it award the qualifications, that is done by independent providers who are subject to quality control. The SIA decides what areas the training has to cover. It is important that the quality of the providers is maintained but, providing that happens, it seemed to me to be a satisfactory system of training."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "Training providers for the SIA qualification are not meant to rely to a large extent on document‑based online teaching, sometimes referred to as e‑learning. While e‑learning is a convenient method of teaching large numbers of people without having to get them all together, the evidence at the Inquiry was that it is difficult to ensure that the training is properly carried out and it may be possible for the student to make it look as if the training has been done when it has not. That was the case with at least one of the employees of Showsec. There was another example of a Showsec employee doing e‑learning on his mobile phone which is unlikely to have been a suitable way to ensure adequate training. Simply using good quality e‑learning material is not sufficient. What is important is ensuring that the trainees have absorbed the learning. As was said in other contexts in the Inquiry, the learning needs to become part of the ‘muscle memory’. I recommend that there should not be undue reliance on e‑learning and its limitations need to be recognised."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that if e‑learning is used, there should be follow‑up to ensure that the training has been understood. This can either be done while the job is being carried out or in a classroom. If this follow‑up is carried out while the job is being carried out, it should be timetabled and recorded."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The SIA says that even with employees who are licence holders, it expects employers to provide continuous training. An issue arose as to whether training should be provided during paid time or during the employees own time. It seemed to be generally accepted within the security and crowd control industry that stewards who have been accepted for work but have not yet started should do their basic training during their own time."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The reason for this is that people who have been accepted as employees not infrequently do not take up the job, having found something else to do. While it is understandable that future employees are not paid for this time, it provides an incentive not to do the training especially as the training at that stage is most frequently e‑learning. This makes it all the more important to ensure that new employees have diligently undertaken this training."

            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that employees should get further training after they have started their employment and they are paid for that training time.

In case it may be helpful, I will set out my present thinking on the evidence that I have heard so far.

It is this that makes it necessary for a decision to be made on primacy."

              "Recommendation": "It makes sense to me that routine policing of the City Room, by which I mean policing on days when there is no event taking place at the Arena, should remain with BTP. BTP will be on site because its officers police the station. As a result of BTP’s policing of the City Room to date, its officers have formed good relationships with the occupiers of the whole Victoria Exchange Complex and there is no suggestion that they have not done routine policing satisfactorily."

If there were to be a major incident connected with the Arena, it is inevitable that GMP would become involved in dealing with it.

              "Recommendation": "The handling of major incidents by BTP is done from Birmingham and/or London.

              "Recommendation": "If GMP are going to have to deal with any major incident arising from an event, it would seem sensible that GMP should be in charge of the policing intended to prevent a major incident happening. It would also have the additional benefit that GMP would be on site if anything was to happen. Although it is a matter of detail which is best decided by the individual police services, there seems to me to be good reason for primacy to transfer before the doors open for the event and transfer back a short period after the doors are closed."

This kind of behaviour is consistent with the development of a violent extremist mindset, but is not necessarily an indication of it by any means.

Where the child is aged between 13 and under 16 years old, a report need not be made where the mandated reporter reasonably believes that: the relationship between the parties is consensual and not intimidatory, exploitative or coercive; and the child has not been harmed and is not at risk of being harmed; and there is no material difference in capacity or maturity between the parties engaged in the sexual activity concerned, and there is a difference in age of no more than three years. These exceptions should not, however, apply where the alleged perpetrator is in a position of trust within the meaning of the 2003 Act. Where the child is under the age of 13, a report must always be made. Reports should be made to either local authority children’s social care or the police as soon as is practicable.

Applicants must have experienced child sexual abuse and exploitation where there is a clear connection to State or non-State institutions in England and Wales. The scheme should be open to any victim of child sexual abuse that took place prior to its establishment. The scheme should deduct any previous award from any payment under the scheme (or in the case of payments made by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, it may order that they be repaid). Applicants who have previously brought civil claims which have been rejected by the court should be excluded from applying to the scheme, save where their cases have been rejected due to limitation. Redress provided: The scheme should provide payments to eligible applicants through a two-tier system, based on a fixed flat-rate recognition payment, with the option to apply for a second-tier payment. Process: The application process must be accessible and straightforward, and be sensitive to the needs and vulnerabilities of victims and survivors of child sexual abuse. The process should provide for streamlined checks and verification of applications, but not be adversarial. There should be special provisions to accelerate awards for older or terminally ill applicants. Duration: The scheme should run for five years.
