Where possible, wards should have areas where more mobile patients and their visitors can meet in relative privacy and comfort without disturbing other patients.   The NHS should develop a greater willingness to communicate by email with relatives.   The currently common practice of summary discharge letters followed up some time later with more substantive ones should be reconsidered.   Information about an older patient’s condition, progress and care and discharge plans should be available and shared with that patient and, where appropriate, those close to them, who must be included in the therapeutic partnership to which all patients are entitled."

            "Recommendation": "There is a need for all to accept common information practices, and to feed performance information into shared databases for monitoring purposes. The following principles should be applied in considering the introduction of electronic patient information systems:   Patients need to be granted user friendly, real time and retrospective access to read their records, and a facility to enter comments. They should be enabled to have a copy of records in a form useable by them, if they wish to have one. If possible, the summary care record should be made accessible in this way.   Systems should be designed to include prompts and defaults where these will contribute to safe and effective care, and to accurate recording of information on first entry.   Systems should include a facility to alert supervisors where actions which might be expected have not occurred, or where likely inaccuracies have been entered.   Systems should, where practicable and proportionate, be capable of collecting performance management and audit information automatically, appropriately anonymised direct from entries, to avoid unnecessary duplication of input.   Systems must be designed by healthcare professionals in partnership with patient groups to secure maximum professional and patient engagement in ensuring accuracy, utility and relevance, both to the needs of the individual patients and collective professional, managerial and regulatory requirements.\nSystems must be capable of reflecting changing needs and local requirements over and above nationally required minimum standards."

          {"Recommendation": " My overarching impression from the evidence is that on 22nd May 2017 and in the lead up to the Ariana Grande concert, inadequate attention was paid to the national level of the terrorist threat by those directly concerned with security at the Arena. The threat level was severe. That meant that a terrorist attack was highly likely.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " None of those directly concerned with security at the Arena on 22nd May 2017 considered it a realistic possibility that a terrorist attack would happen there.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " If SMG had paid greater attention to the threat level, it would have taken more steps to mitigate the danger of a terrorist attack in the City Room on 22nd May.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " If Showsec had paid greater attention to the threat level, it would have taken more steps to mitigate the danger of a terrorist attack in the City Room on 22nd May.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " If Mohammed Agha and Kyle Lawler had considered the concerns expressed to them about SA in light of the threat level, they would have made greater efforts to ensure those concerns were reported to their supervisors.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " If BTP officers had that level of risk in their minds when they carried out their duties that night, they would not have been absent for such a long period from the public areas of the Victoria Exchange Complex. In particular, one of them would have been in the City Room in the half hour period before egress and therefore during part of the period that SA waited there before detonating his bomb.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " One of the reasons why inadequate attention was paid to the threat level was that it had been in place for some years. I make no criticism in respect of the length of the period during which a severe risk was identified. As long as the threat level is severe, the appropriate level of vigilance must be maintained. The problem is that it becomes more and more difficult to ensure that people maintain the high level of alertness required in relation to potential dangers. A high level of alertness needs to be maintained when the threat level is severe. It is necessary to continuously remind those whose job includes being alert to the terrorist threat of the level of it and what that level means in relation to the possibility of an attack.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " There ought to be a risk assessment for every venue. A specific risk assessment for each event which involves the attendance of a substantial number of people. All risk assessments for large concert venues should include consideration of the risk of a terrorist attack. Inadequate consideration of that risk may result in incorrectly identifying a low risk. This in turn may cause those responsible for security to be insufficiently alert. That is what occurred here.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " It was suggested during the evidence that this was unnecessary, as everyone knew the threat level of a terrorist attack and would have regard to it in the way they behaved. I do not agree. While in theory that may be true, the discipline of undertaking a risk assessment will assist in keeping the threat of terrorism at the forefront of the minds of those who prepare for the event. Robust procedures are necessary to counter the threat of a terrorist attack. The purposes of those procedures and the necessity of following them must be understood by those carrying them out.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " The following are three examples of procedures which should have been more robust.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " It needed to be made absolutely clear and to be understood by the BTP officers that patrolling the areas of egress in the half hour before the end of the concert was not optional, it was mandatory because of the security risk. There needed to be at least one experienced police officer on duty at the Victoria Exchange Complex on the occasions of concerts, preferably a sergeant, in addition to inexperienced officers, to ensure that nobody forgot the threat level and carried out their instructions with it in mind.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " The pre‑egress checks carried out by Showsec ignored almost entirely the terrorist threat. Those checks concentrated instead on making sure that the exit routes for the crowd were clear. That was important but it was also important that there should have been a counter‑terrorism aspect to the checks. Anyone who had the threat level at the forefront of their mind would have realised that.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " Showsec should have understood that its staff had a responsibility to check the mezzanine as part of a security patrol. SMG should have had a system in place to make sure that security patrols were taking place and being carried out properly.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " In order for necessary security procedures to be maintained, each person needs to be reminded of the counter‑terrorism aspect of their activities. The message that counter‑terrorism measures are vital needs to be constantly reinforced. Those responsible for security should be briefed at every event about the current threat level and risk of terrorist attack.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " I accept that repeating the same warning about terrorism as part of each briefing creates a risk of it being ignored and those who have heard it before may listen less than attentively.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " The evidence I heard from Showsec is a good illustration of this issue. The Showsec supervisors’ and stewards’ briefings on 22nd May 2017 both include the importance of being vigilant for suspicious behaviour. As the events which followed demonstrate, that was insufficient to keep people safe. However, the fact that this measure was not effective on this occasion is not a reason to abandon it. Rather, it is a reason to do it better.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " Those receiving the warning about the risk of attack have to be aware of the potential that they will become desensitised to the message. Those giving the warning need to be aware of this and must try to refresh the message so that it is sufficiently updated and relevant to attract the attention of the listener.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " Showsec operated a system of having a period within the supervisors’ briefing for a particular topic which was selected from a number of possible options, one of which was counter‑terrorism. This was, in my view, a good way to ensure that additional detail was provided without the subject matter becoming stale. Any and all suspicious behaviour by event‑goers or members of the public close to a venue must be noted. It must be reported promptly so that investigations can be made and action taken, if appropriate.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " When this recommendation is followed there will be false alarms. While this may be frustrating, it is important that the way false alarms are dealt with does not discourage the reporting of suspicious behaviour. If unnecessary reports are made, the remedy should be to train staff better to recognise suspicious behaviour, rather than criticise them for making the report. It is not easy for staff, particularly junior ones, to make reports that they know may result in disruption to an event or inconvenience a large number of people. They need to be given the confidence to do so.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " Bomb hoaxes can cause great inconvenience, but no‑one can safely ignore bomb warnings. So it is with suspicious behaviour. It should only be ignored when an innocent explanation has been verified. There was evidence of a number of such false alarms during the Inquiry, but staff should be congratulated and not criticised either expressly or implicitly for raising the alarm. Showsec and SMG were clear that they did their best to get this message across but, on the evidence, it did not seem to have got through to all of their staff. In particular, the system for capturing reports and ensuring their proper investigation was not sufficiently robust.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": " Where hostile reconnaissance is suspected it needs to be properly recorded and reported to the police. The police should investigate it and report back. Briefings to security staff need to include details of the suspected hostile reconnaissance. This is so that staff know what has happened and know what to look out for.", "changeType": ""},
          {"Recommendation": "In some cases, the steps required of Protect Duty‑holders will be obvious and straightforward. In these cases expert input may be disproportionate. These Protect Duty‑holders should be able to take the necessary steps by accessing publicly available information as to how they should approach their tasks. Below I make recommendations as to how NaCTSO may be able to make a contribution to ensuring the required information is available to those who need it."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "In cases in which preparing the Protect Plan is not straightforward and the Protect Duty‑holder, such as a charity, does not have the means to pay for assistance, consideration should be given to providing state help for the preparation of the Plan and its implementation."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The Protect Plan should set out the ‘reasonably practicable’ measures to be taken to mitigate the risk of a terrorist attack."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "Once prepared, in some cases the police and other state agencies may wish to have an input into the plan before it finalised."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "A timetable will need to be set. There will need to be provision for regular reviews and enforcement process. Reviews will not only be needed to ensure that the Protect Plan is still being implemented but to consider possible changes if the terrorist threat alters."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The Protect Plan should identify which roles will include a counter‑terrorism element. These roles are essential to the successful discharge of the Protect Duty. It is critical that those undertaking these roles are selected with care. This will include ensuring that they have the necessary maturity and confidence to speak up should the situation arise. It should also include ensuring a background check proportionate to the role that they are undertaking has been conducted."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that the Protect Plan identifies the approach which will be taken to ensuring that only appropriate people undertake work which includes a counter‑terrorism element."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "Part of the Protect Duty proposals include the provision of training in counter‑terrorism. The higher‑level training provided by the SIA for employees occupying certain positions should be retained but it is important that managers and all employees have some training. ACT which is a training scheme set up by NaCTSO is suitable for people working in the industry at all levels. All people working in venues such as the Arena should be trained in the basics of counter‑terrorism. The nature of the threat changes so it is important that there is regular refresher training."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The provision of adequate training should form a key control measure within the Protect Plan. This will include consideration of the need for enhanced training for those in roles which require it."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that staff training should form a mandatory part of the Protect Plan."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "It was a common feature of the regulatory schemes that I have heard about during the Inquiry that there were insufficient resources to carry out proper enforcement. The consequence of that is that there have been a number of breaches of regulations which might have been avoided with more active enforcement."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "It is important that there is proper enforcement of the Protect Duty, the possible consequences of breaches are so serious that proper steps need to be taken to avoid them happening. It is possible that CTSAs, licensing officers, police licensing enforcement officers and the SIA could all combine to provide enforcement. Even if that happens, it is likely that more people will be required to carry out the work. When cutbacks occur, enforcement can be one of the first areas to lose staff. It would be a false economy in relation to enforcement of the Protect Duty. I recommend that an adequate and effective enforcement process is established in relation to the Protect Duty."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The proposal is that there should be a system of enforcement to ensure that the terms of the Protect Plan which has been determined are complied with. I am satisfied on the evidence that I have heard that there needs to be an enforcement mechanism and the ability to impose a penalty if there is a breach. Part of the reason for the failure of other schemes has been that they have been voluntary. The Consultation suggests that the penalty should be restricted to a civil penalty which would be financial. In those circumstances there would be no conviction. While it is not unusual to have civil penalties for regulatory failures, provision is often made for criminal prosecutions and more severe penalties in more serious cases. I would recommend that the same should apply for breaches of the Protect Duty. It should be borne in mind that this is an area where the possibility of a severe sentence could have a deterrent effect."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "In my view, there is no good reason to put in place an enforcement regime that is any less rigorous or robust in terms of inspection, enforcement and penalty than that which exists in the parallel health and safety legislation. Given what is at stake, namely the lives of people going about their everyday business, there is every reason to make the Protect Duty equally rigorous and robust."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "Whatever the legislature decides about penalty for breach, inspection and enforcement is likely to be the main deterrent. A proper inspection regime needs to be in force so that serious security breaches are identified and promptly remedied. Even if enforcement is regarded as light touch it is important that there is proper inspection. An effective enforcement regime requires sufficient people to do it properly. All the evidence that I heard suggests that insufficient resources have been put into the present inspection regimes. A proper inspection policy should provide for unannounced inspections as well as planned ones. It may be that the roles of different inspectors can be combined so that for example inspectors looking to see that the Protect Duty was being complied with could also be checking in appropriate locations that licensing conditions are being observed."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I envisage that this may follow a similar approach to that used in relation to health and safety and food standards. By this I mean the existence of a mechanism for issuing a formal notice setting out the remedial steps which are required in relation to any identified deficiencies. For extreme situations, there must be provision for issuing a notice that prevents a venue from operating until remedial steps have been taken. The notice will provide a timescale for compliance. It will also be necessary to have an appeal process for the adjudication on the appropriateness of the terms of the notice, should there be a dispute. It should be a criminal offence to fail to comply with a valid notice without reasonable excuse."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "Operators, and people who work for them, are often under financial pressure to try and make savings as has been evident during this Inquiry. I understand that is the commercial reality, but it does mean that a proper inspection regime is needed to give some assurance that savings will not be made at the cost of safety. The security measures may be expensive. It must be more costly to an organisation and individuals to cut corners than to comply with the Protect Duty."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that enforcement of the Protect Duty is at least as robust and rigorous as comparable regulatory regimes.Communication, coordination and co‑operation between enforcement authorities with overlapping regimes in connection with the Protect Duty8.93 The various regulatory bodies who have responsibility for safety at premises like the Arena need to operate together. CTSAs, the SIA, the Licensing Authority, the Health and Safety Executive and the police all have responsibilities for public safety at premises of this kind. They need to understand what each of them is doing in relation to any particular premises so they do not duplicate but can provide complementary services. I will be reviewing the progress of this as part of my monitoring of the Protect Duty."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that regulators and other state agencies with responsibilities that engage with any Protect Duty co‑operate, coordinate and communicate."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "As well as looking at measures aimed at preventing a terrorist attack, I recommend that the government should also look at simple measures to help to save lives should an attack occur. It has become clear to me during the evidence that it would be beneficial if employees of companies which have a Protect Duty, including SMG and Showsec, were trained in first aid relevant to injuries of the type caused during the Attack on 22nd May 2017."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that Protect Duty‑holders are required to ensure that employees are trained in first aid relevant to injuries which are particularly likely to occur during a terrorist attack."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The suggestion made by Showsec that NaCTSO should set up a centralised online library where it will be possible to access training material is a good one. This will help in particular smaller organisations who cannot afford to employ professional help to assist them with a Protect Duty. Thought will need to be given to how access might be gained to this to ensure that this information is not misused by those seeking to do harm."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that NaCTSO sets up a centralised online library for training materials freely accessible to those subject to the Protect Duty."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The approach taken by SMG in its written risk assessments involved a numerical assessment of the likelihood of a terrorist attack. This was then used as a multiplier against a severity score. I have considerable reservations about this approach being used in connection with the threat from terrorism. This concern arises from the potential that a strictly statistical approach may suppress any total score to the point where the risk of a terrorist attack is regarded as being sufficiently low as to be acceptable and no action is taken."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "There are at least three ways that this could be addressed. One option is to remove consideration of likelihood from the process altogether. This will result in a focus on what can be done without providing for an opportunity for the thought, ‘It will not happen to me’, entering the process. Another is to import it only in relation to drawing a distinction between different attack methodologies. Some spaces may be naturally highly protected from a particular form of attack. In those circumstances, having a mechanism to ensure focus is on the more likely methodologies may be advantageous. A third approach may be to ensure that the severity score range is sufficiently wide so that even when a low likelihood is applied, the total score still remains high enough to produce the necessary measures. A high severity score is clearly justified when considering the very high degree of harm a terrorist attack is capable of causing. I do not believe that a range of between 1 to 5, as was used by SMG, is sufficiently wide."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "However, I have not heard sufficient evidence to express a concluded view  on the best way to complete such a risk assessment. Nor have I heard expert evidence on the subject to inform me. In my view, NaCTSO is likely to have access to the necessary expertise to consider this issue in detail, identify the best approach and issue readily understandable guidance."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The Health and Safety Executive makes publicly available, via its website, guidance on the completion of a risk assessment, together with a template in the health and safety context."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that a similar facility should be made available by NaCTSO in relating to the risk of a terrorist attack."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "As I have already set out, the SIA licences individuals working in the security industry to carry out certain activities. Amongst those activities is operating CCTV over a public space. At present, a licence is only required by those who monitor CCTV under a contract for services. In‑house CCTV operators do not need a licence. Although an attempt was made to justify the reasoning for this distinction by Tony Holyland, a senior employee at the SIA, I was unpersuaded. This distinction has been considered in the past, but no change has been made. In‑house operators carry out the same job as those who monitor CCTV under a contract for services. The Inquiry heard evidence that more than one SMG employee who carried out monitoring of CCTVs asked for training but were not given it. There seems to me to be no persuasive reason why a licence should not be mandatory for those operating in‑house as well as those working under a contract for services. I recommend that the distinction is abolished. All of those who monitor CCTV should be required to hold an SIA CCTV operator’s licence."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "In addition to licensing individuals, the SIA runs an Approved Contractor Scheme (ACS). This is a voluntary scheme and, while individuals who carry out security work may require a licence or licences depending on what functions they carry out, companies who provide security and supervise these activities do not. While the ACS provides assurance that the member is a fit and proper person, there is nothing to prevent someone who is not a member of the scheme setting up and running a company providing security services. The SIA promotes good practice through its ACS. But there is no compulsion on companies to become a member or carry out good practice. While checks are made on how a company conducts its business when it applies to join the scheme, self‑certification plays a considerable part in the process."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that consideration is given to amending the SIA legislation to require that companies which carry out security work which may include a counter‑terrorism element are required to be licensed. This will ensure that only fit and proper companies carry out this work. It will also ensure that they are aware of and guard against the risks of terrorist attacks at the events where they operate and carry out proper procedures, including training to mitigate those risks."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "Training for an SIA qualification is designed to be mainly classroom‑based. The SIA does not provide the training itself nor does it award the qualifications, that is done by independent providers who are subject to quality control. The SIA decides what areas the training has to cover. It is important that the quality of the providers is maintained but, providing that happens, it seemed to me to be a satisfactory system of training."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "Training providers for the SIA qualification are not meant to rely to a large extent on document‑based online teaching, sometimes referred to as e‑learning. While e‑learning is a convenient method of teaching large numbers of people without having to get them all together, the evidence at the Inquiry was that it is difficult to ensure that the training is properly carried out and it may be possible for the student to make it look as if the training has been done when it has not. That was the case with at least one of the employees of Showsec. There was another example of a Showsec employee doing e‑learning on his mobile phone which is unlikely to have been a suitable way to ensure adequate training. Simply using good quality e‑learning material is not sufficient. What is important is ensuring that the trainees have absorbed the learning. As was said in other contexts in the Inquiry, the learning needs to become part of the ‘muscle memory’. I recommend that there should not be undue reliance on e‑learning and its limitations need to be recognised."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that if e‑learning is used, there should be follow‑up to ensure that the training has been understood. This can either be done while the job is being carried out or in a classroom. If this follow‑up is carried out while the job is being carried out, it should be timetabled and recorded."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The SIA says that even with employees who are licence holders, it expects employers to provide continuous training. An issue arose as to whether training should be provided during paid time or during the employees own time. It seemed to be generally accepted within the security and crowd control industry that stewards who have been accepted for work but have not yet started should do their basic training during their own time."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The reason for this is that people who have been accepted as employees not infrequently do not take up the job, having found something else to do. While it is understandable that future employees are not paid for this time, it provides an incentive not to do the training especially as the training at that stage is most frequently e‑learning. This makes it all the more important to ensure that new employees have diligently undertaken this training."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "I recommend that employees should get further training after they have started their employment and they are paid for that training time. Training is important and it requires both employees and employers to take it seriously. Giving payment for doing it would encourage this and ensure that employees realise that employers take it seriously."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The issue of primacy is relevant to both Volumes 1 and 2 of my Report. For that reason, I will not be giving any final recommendation on primacy until I publish the part of the Report which deals with the emergency response. I have received from BTP and GMP an interim memorandum776 on the policing of the Victoria Exchange Complex for which I am grateful and which I have considered. In case it may be helpful, I will set out my present thinking on the evidence that I have heard so far. While there may be other sites where similar considerations arise and my recommendations may be relevant to them, I do understand that the issues at different sites are likely to be unique both in terms of location and resources."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "It is important that any decision about this is made solely on the basis of providing the best policing service for the public. There is always a risk that decisions will be influenced by a desire to retain areas of work because to do otherwise may be perceived as a of lack of competence. Equally, there can be a desire to take over another area of work to increase the influence and reach of a particular organisation."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "As I set out in Part 7, BTP officers have jurisdiction to act with the powers of a constable in the Victoria Exchange Complex because of the ownership of the site by Network Rail. GMP officers also have such jurisdiction. They are concurrent jurisdictions. During the evidence it seemed that this fact was not clear to all officers. It is this that makes it necessary for a decision to be made on primacy."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "It makes sense to me that routine policing of the City Room, by which I mean policing on days when there is no event taking place at the Arena, should remain with BTP. BTP will be on site because its officers police the station. As a result of BTP’s policing of the City Room to date, its officers have formed good relationships with the occupiers of the whole Victoria Exchange Complex and there is no suggestion that they have not done routine policing satisfactorily."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "On event days, the situation is different. If there were to be a major incident connected with the Arena, it is inevitable that GMP would become involved in dealing with it. It is always likely to be the position, and certainly is the case now, that GMP will have greater resources immediately available than BTP in order to deal with a major incident in Manchester."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "The handling of major incidents by BTP is done from Birmingham and/or London. While it is possible to do this with the assistance of modern technology, there will always be advantages in dealing with the matter locally if, for no other reason, because of a greater knowledge of the area.776 INQ040967"
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "If GMP are going to have to deal with any major incident arising from an event, it would seem sensible that GMP should be in charge of the policing intended to prevent a major incident happening. It would also have the additional benefit that GMP would be on site if anything was to happen. Although it is a matter of detail which is best decided by the individual police services, there seems to me to be good reason for primacy to transfer before the doors open for the event and transfer back a short period after the doors are closed."
            },
            {
              "Recommendation": "Finally, GMP may already be involved in policing any crowd leaving the Arena when they come onto the street and it would be convenient for GMP to police the area right up to the time when the crowd has dispersed from it."
            },

This kind of behaviour is consistent with the development of a violent extremist mindset, but is not necessarily an indication of it by any means.

The following persons should be designated ‘mandated reporters’: any person working in regulated activity in relation to children (under the Safeguarding and Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, as amended); any person working in a position of trust (as defined by the Sexual Offences Act 2003, as amended); and police officers. For the purposes of mandatory reporting, ‘child sexual abuse’ should be interpreted as any act that would be an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 where the alleged victim is a child under the age of 18. Where the child is aged between 13 and under 16 years old, a report need not be made where the mandated reporter reasonably believes that: the relationship between the parties is consensual and not intimidatory, exploitative or coercive; and the child has not been harmed and is not at risk of being harmed; and there is no material difference in capacity or maturity between the parties engaged in the sexual activity concerned, and there is a difference in age of no more than three years. These exceptions should not, however, apply where the alleged perpetrator is in a position of trust within the meaning of the 2003 Act. Where the child is under the age of 13, a report must always be made. Reports should be made to either local authority children’s social care or the police as soon as is practicable.

Applicants must have experienced child sexual abuse and exploitation where there is a clear connection to State or non-State institutions in England and Wales. The scheme should be open to any victim of child sexual abuse that took place prior to its establishment. The scheme should deduct any previous award from any payment under the scheme (or in the case of payments made by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, it may order that they be repaid). Applicants who have previously brought civil claims which have been rejected by the court should be excluded from applying to the scheme, save where their cases have been rejected due to limitation. Redress provided: The scheme should provide payments to eligible applicants through a two-tier system, based on a fixed flat-rate recognition payment, with the option to apply for a second-tier payment. Process: The application process must be accessible and straightforward, and be sensitive to the needs and vulnerabilities of victims and survivors of child sexual abuse. The process should provide for streamlined checks and verification of applications, but not be adversarial. There should be special provisions to accelerate awards for older or terminally ill applicants. Duration: The scheme should run for five years.

This should be a priority for the Northern Ireland Executive. From the experience of this Inquiry, a revised code would among other things:  • explain how Ministers are expected to fulfil their responsibilities when leading a Department and determining a Department’s policies;  • make clear that Ministers have an active role in questioning and challenging the advice they receive;  • cross-reference to Ministers’ duties under “Managing Public Money Northern Ireland”;  • be clear that, unless and until the legislation is changed, each Minister is individually responsible for the recruitment, management and discipline of his/her SpAd, including for observing the Northern Ireland laws and guidance in force in relation to SpAds;  • clarify expectations about collaboration and joint working between Ministers of different Departments as well as an individual Minister’s responsibility to support the Government in Northern Ireland as a whole; Consideration should also include whether recent changes to the Westminster, Scottish Executive and Welsh Government Ministerial Codes of Conduct could be relevant to the Northern Ireland context.
