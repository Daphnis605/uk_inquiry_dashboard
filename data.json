This necessitates providing senior decision-makers with data-driven reports on project performance and forecasts combined with reports by the management team and independent audits. • In reporting to governance bodies there should be special emphasis on detecting early warning signs that the cost, schedule and benefit risks may be materialising so that damage to the project can be prevented. If early warning signs do emerge, the project should revisit assumptions and reassess risk and optimism bias forecasts. • The quality of evidence rather than process is the key to providing effective oversight and validation.",

The problem is that it becomes more and more difficult to ensure that people maintain the high level of alertness required in relation to potential dangers. A high level of alertness needs to be maintained when the threat level is severe.

It is possible that CTSAs, licensing officers, police licensing enforcement officers and the SIA could all combine to provide enforcement. Even if that happens, it is likely that more people will be required to carry out the work. When cutbacks occur, enforcement can be one of the first areas to lose staff.

I am satisfied on the evidence that I have heard that there needs to be an enforcement mechanism and the ability to impose a penalty if there is a breach. Part of the reason for the failure of other schemes has been that they have been voluntary. The Consultation suggests that the penalty should be restricted to a civil penalty which would be financial. In those circumstances there would be no conviction. While it is not unusual to have civil penalties for regulatory failures, provision is often made for criminal prosecutions and more severe penalties in more serious cases. I would recommend that the same should apply for breaches of the Protect Duty. It should be borne in mind that this is an area where the possibility of a severe sentence could have a deterrent effect.",

A proper inspection regime needs to be in force so that serious security breaches are identified and promptly remedied. Even if enforcement is regarded as light touch it is important that there is proper inspection. An effective enforcement regime requires sufficient people to do it properly. All the evidence that I heard suggests that insufficient resources have been put into the present inspection regimes. A proper inspection policy should provide for unannounced inspections as well as planned ones.

For extreme situations, there must be provision for issuing a notice that prevents a venue from operating until remedial steps have been taken. The notice will provide a timescale for compliance.

This will result in a focus on what can be done without providing for an opportunity for the thought, ‘It will not happen to me’, entering the process. Another is to import it only in relation to drawing a distinction between different attack methodologies. Some spaces may be naturally highly protected from a particular form of attack. In those circumstances, having a mechanism to ensure focus is on the more likely methodologies may be advantageous. A third approach may be to ensure that the severity score range is sufficiently wide so that even when a low likelihood is applied, the total score still remains high enough to produce the necessary measures. A high severity score is clearly justified when considering the very high degree of harm a terrorist attack is capable of causing. I do not believe that a range of between 1 to 5, as was used by SMG, is sufficiently wide.",

In‑house CCTV operators do not need a licence. Although an attempt was made to justify the reasoning for this distinction by Tony Holyland, a senior employee at the SIA, I was unpersuaded. This distinction has been considered in the past, but no change has been made. In‑house operators carry out the same job as those who monitor CCTV under a contract for services. The Inquiry heard evidence that more than one SMG employee who carried out monitoring of CCTVs asked for training but were not given it. There seems to me to be no persuasive reason why a licence should not be mandatory for those operating in‑house as well as those working under a contract for services. I recommend that the distinction is abolished. All of those who monitor CCTV should be required to hold an SIA CCTV operator’s licence.",

That was the case with at least one of the employees of Showsec. There was another example of a Showsec employee doing e‑learning on his mobile phone which is unlikely to have been a suitable way to ensure adequate training. Simply using good quality e‑learning material is not sufficient. What is important is ensuring that the trainees have absorbed the learning. As was said in other contexts in the Inquiry, the learning needs to become part of the ‘muscle memory’.

The scheme should be open to any victim of child sexual abuse that took place prior to its establishment.

Applicants who have previously brought civil claims which have been rejected by the court should be excluded from applying to the scheme, save where their cases have been rejected due to limitation. Redress provided: The scheme should provide payments to eligible applicants through a two-tier system, based on a fixed flat-rate recognition payment, with the option to apply for a second-tier payment. Process: The application process must be accessible and straightforward, and be sensitive to the needs and vulnerabilities of victims and survivors of child sexual abuse. The process should provide for streamlined checks and verification of applications, but not be adversarial. There should be special provisions to accelerate awards for older or terminally ill applicants. Duration: The scheme should run for five years.
